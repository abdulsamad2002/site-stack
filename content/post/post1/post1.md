This site will be a place where I can share my projects, knowledge, and experiences as I dive deeper into the world of Computer Science and Cybersecurity.

### What to Expect
On this site, you can find:

- Blog posts about cybersecurity.
- Insights into my learning journey and the challenges I face as a student.
- Updates on my personal projects and achievements in the tech field.

### Why I Built This Site
As a computer science and engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, I wanted to create a space to not only document my journey but also to share useful information and resources with others. Through this website I aim to giving back to the community.

I hope this website will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in technology and cyber defense.
